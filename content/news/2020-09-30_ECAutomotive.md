Join us for the Automotive@Eclipse session, part of the Community Day at EclipseCon 2020. In the first part of the session youâ€™ll hear from each of the five automotive related working groups who work in areas from the development of an autonomous driving toolchain to traffic simulations and measurement data management. In the second half, Panorama will be presented to the community before a discussion on future initiatives to grow the synergies amongst the working groups. Visit the [website](https://www.eclipsecon.org/2020/community-day) for more information.
