The ForSyDe group at KTH is proud to present ForSyDe IO, our new system-level representation. 

<!--more-->

Birthed as an outcome of collaboration and discussion between KTH and other PANORAMA partners, ForSyDe IO encompasses the identified needs of representing executable models-of-computations and predictable platforms. As a bonus, the underlying abstractions enable a single-time engineering effort to port the model libraries to different languages.

Currently, java and python supporting libraries are available. Since 0.3.8, the java port has connections with AMALTHEA models 1.1.0 and newer.
