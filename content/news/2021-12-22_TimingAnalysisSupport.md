The research groups at **Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts**,
**Robert Bosch GmbH**, and **Vector Informatik GmbH** are proud to present their
joint publication on complex event models, which appeared in a special
issue of the [Journal of Systems Architecture (JSA)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sysarc.2021.102343n).

It provides a comprehensive overview of
activation patterns that are employed in the automotive industry, and a
detailed description of their execution semantics. Moreover, it proposes
event models corresponding to these activation patterns in order to
enable the application of common performance analysis techniques.
Finally, it demonstrates the usage of these models on a case study in
the context of compositional performance analysis, and quantifies the
possible improvement when bounding response times in comparison to the
usage of chained task sets.
