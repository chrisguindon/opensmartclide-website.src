We are pleased to announce that our proposal to submit our code as an open-source platform extending Eclipse Theia has been accepted by the Eclipse community. Our code will be hosted under the name:

## Eclipse OpenSmartCLIDE

Next step: submit our initial contribution for IP review.
You can already read the description of our open-source project here:

[https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ecd.opensmartclide](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ecd.opensmartclide)

For the record, our code was developed in an open and public manner under the umbrella of **Eclipse Research Labs**, an infrastructure of the Eclipse Foundation dedicated to supporting research projects under development that are not yet ready to be released as an open-source Eclipse project: respecting open-source license compatibilities, business-friendly, contributor agreements, and copyright completeness.
