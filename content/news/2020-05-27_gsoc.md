The Panorama toolchain leverages several Eclipse Foundation projects including [Eclipse APP4MC] (https://www.eclipse.org/app4mc/) and [Eclipse Capra] (https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.capra). The toolchain will be enhanced both technically and in audience reach by the acceptance of these APP4MC projects for inclusion in the Google Summer of Code 2020. 

GSoC is an annual programming scholarship organized by Google  that brings together students who want to contribute to open source projects, project mentors and the organizations hosting these projects."
