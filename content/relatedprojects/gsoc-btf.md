On behalf of his Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2020 project Anand Prakash developed a framework to generate BTF specification conform traces by extending the Real Time Parallella Framework. The generated trace file can be viewed on external tools such as Eclipse Trace Compass in order to inspect and analyze the run-time behavior on the cores of the Adapteva Epiphany Many-Core Chip. In order to simplify the usage of his tool, he extended the Eclipse APP4MC code generator to synthesize code for the tracing functionality.
