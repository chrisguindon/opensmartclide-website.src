Philip Okonkwo's Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2020 project aimed at visualizing the execution trace of a simulated APP4MC models including task states following a variety of Eclipse APP4MC's execution semantics. The implementation was realized using the Nebula Timeline Framework. In order to provide some rudimentary simulation results for the Graphical User Interface, he furthermore implemented a simple simulation engine that supports various scheduling algorithms and serves as a source for the visualization front-end.
