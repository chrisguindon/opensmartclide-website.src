ForSyDe is a methodology that provides a formal basis for modeling and design of heterogeneous systems-on-chip and cyber-physical systems. It has been designed to meet several requirements including focusing on functionality in early design stages, incorporating formal methods and verification at the outset and employing formal refinement techniques to bridge the gap between specifications and implementation.
