## Deployment Alternatives

Embedded systems are becoming increasingly complex and more distributed. Cost and quality requirements necessitate the reuse of functional software components for multiple deployment architectures. An important step is the allocation of software components to hardware and its resources. During this process, the differences between the hardware and application software must be reconciled. Within Panorama we are using static and dynamic analysis methods to test the specific scenarios described by requirements and system boundaries. With this information, we consider different deployment scenarios for the system and provide results to assist in assessing which deployment solution provides the best fit for a given scenario.
