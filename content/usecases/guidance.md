## Guidance

Optimization is an essential part of most engineering and business endeavors. However, heterogeneous systems quickly grow unfathomable due to the big number of choices the designer must make regarding partitioning alternatives, application parameters, communication patterns, among others. Furthermore, at a higher level of system abstraction, it is not uncommon for the designer to struggle to find a feasible deployment alternative, let alone an optimal one. Therefore, within Panorama, the project partners seek to develop procedures which can automatically or semi-automatically make decisions for the designer as to bridge the gap between system-level representation and deployment-ready representation while respecting imposed design constraints and optimizing towards performance metrics such as power consumption.
