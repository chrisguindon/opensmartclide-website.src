## ForSyDe
ForSyDe is a methodology that provides a formal basis for modeling and design of heterogeneous systems-on-chip and cyber-physical systems. It has been designed to meet several requirements including focusing on functionality in early design stages, incorporating formal methods and verification at the outset and employing formal refinement techniques to bridge the gap between specifications and implementation.

## Arcticus Rubus Tool Suite
Rubus ICE is an integrated development environment supporting the software development of different applications ranging from small time-critical embedded systems to very large mixed time-critical and non-time critical embedded systems. Rubus ICE build on the Rubus Component Model and the Rubus Kernel. The Rubus Kernel is a real-time operating system, which supports both dynamic (Event Triggered threads) and static scheduling (Timed Triggered threads). When using the Rubus Component Model together with the Rubus Kernel, service calls are generated automatically thus providing for the Single Shot Execution (SSX) of threads. Traditional ET-triggered threads utilizing blocking RTOS services are also supported.
